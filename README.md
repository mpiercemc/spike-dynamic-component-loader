questions:
dependencies - Shared things. Where do we put these?
  * ex: where does identity put avatar component?   
  * does record config factory go in shared or record-config?
  
  * how do I ensure they created a component that will work with my factory

  * scrabble tiles - dynamically loaded - we don't know which ones we should be loading - what if a new defined. How do I prevent RExecution from changing their code.
    * how do I order them
  
  * execution
    * how do I access/store data

  * undo/redo? - how can I ask a custom control to undo a config step?
